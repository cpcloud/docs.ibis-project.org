Impala/HDFS intro and Setup
===========================

Getting started
---------------

You're going to want to make sure you can import ``ibis``

.. code:: python

    import ibis
    import os

If you have WebHDFS available, connect to HDFS with according to your
WebHDFS config. For kerberized or more complex HDFS clusters please look
at http://hdfscli.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ for info on connecting. You
can use a connection from that library instead of using ``hdfs_connect``

.. code:: python

    hdfs_port = os.environ.get('IBIS_WEBHDFS_PORT', 50070)
    hdfs = ibis.hdfs_connect(host='quickstart.cloudera', port=hdfs_port)

Finally, create the Ibis client

.. code:: python

    con = ibis.impala.connect('quickstart.cloudera', hdfs_client=hdfs)
    con




.. parsed-literal::

    <ibis.impala.client.ImpalaClient at 0x7f04f55f4950>



Obviously, substitute the parameters that are appropriate for your
environment (see docstring for ``ibis.impala.connect``).
``impala.connect`` uses the same parameters as Impyla's
(https://pypi.python.org/pypi/impyla) DBAPI interface
